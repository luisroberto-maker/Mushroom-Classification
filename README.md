# Mushroom-Classification
##Classification of mushrooms between poisonous and edible using the random forest algorithm 

##Mushroom dataset has 8124 instances corresponding to 23 attributes with mushroom characteristics. Each instance consists of 22 values related to the physical characteristics of each mushroom. 

##To classify this dataset I applied random forest algoritm which is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.

##From the creation, testing and evaluation of the model, it was concluded that it is possible to achieve a "perfect" score when predicting the edibility of mushrooms based on these physical characteristics.
